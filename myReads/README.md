# MyReads Project

A bookshelf web app that allows you to select and categorize books that you have read, are currently, or want to read. This app also allows you to add more books into the bookshelf.

This project is built by React. The client library can be accessed by an API server. Given the he backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
