# Restaurant Review Project
A restaurant review website that can be --
1. responsive on different sized displays
2. accessible for screen reader using `Tab`
3. and able to process seamless offline experience for users.

## How to To Run This Website locally
1. You need to start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this.
2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.
3. For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as python by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
4. With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000.
